should be normal rails setup

This is to demonstrate some ideas I had with using polymorphism instead of if/then/else to perform conditional behavior. It also served as a platform for me to experiment with the `cells` gem.

Have a look at the models. There's a base Order, which is an AR model, but with find overridden to give one of the other types of order (Placed, Charged, Refunded) if necessary. Each model implements `cell` which returns the name of cell to use when rendering it.

The sole controller doesn't do any branching, it simply fetches an order and renders it. There's also no branching in the views (app/cells/).
